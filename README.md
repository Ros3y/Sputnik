# Sputnik

Sputnik is a unique platforming game that propels you through space with powerful energy grenades and your trusty jetpack. You have been sent to investigate an abandoned alien craft floating in space and harness its technology. Can you navigate the treacherous corridors and reach the core to take hold of the ship?

## How to play

Each level has a floating cube at the end called the core. Shoot and reach the core to end the level. Traverse through the levels using your grenades to propel you, and use your jetpack to extend your flight.

Grenades will stick to any surface except glass and will take 1 second to detonate. The exception to this rule is when you shoot at death planes (pulsing/ glowing cubes) the detonation will be instant. 

The death planes will instantly kill the player if they are touched but can also be used to navigate terrain. You can race against your best times by replaying levels. Respawning will always reset this timer.
